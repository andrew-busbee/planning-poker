# Planning Poker

A real-time planning poker application for agile estimation, deployable via Docker. No login required - each session creates a unique game URL that can be shared with team members.

- üÉè **Multiple card decks**: Fibonacci, T-shirt sizing, Powers of 2, Linear, or create your own
- üëÅÔ∏è **Watcher mode** for observers who can reveal votes and reset games
- üîó **Shareable game URLs** - no login required
- üì± **Responsive design** that works on desktop and mobile
- üåì **Light and dark modes** with theme toggle
- üê≥ **Docker deployment** ready

## Quick Start with Docker

The easiest way to deploy the application is with Docker or Docker Compose.  The [sample docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/andrew-busbee/planning-poker/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) file has an optional healthcheck as well:

### Docker
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name planning-poker \
  -p 3001:3001 \
  -e PORT=3001 \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  andrewbusbee/planning-poker:latest

```

### Docker-compose
```yml
services:
  planning-poker:
    image: andrewbusbee/planning-poker:latest
    ports:
      - "3001:3001"
    environment:
      - PORT=3001
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## How to Use

1. **Create a Game**: Enter your name and select a card deck type
2. **Share the URL**: Copy the generated game URL and share it with your team
3. **Join the Game**: Team members can join using the shared URL
4. **Cast Votes**: Select a card to cast your vote (hidden from others)
5. **Reveal Results**: Any player can reveal all votes when ready
6. **Start New Round**: Reset the game to start a new estimation round

### Watcher Mode
- Join as a watcher to observe without voting
- Watchers can reveal votes and start new rounds
- Perfect for stakeholders and managers

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/decks` - Get available card deck configurations
- `GET /api/game/:gameId` - Get game state
- `GET /` - Serve the React application

## WebSocket Events

### Client to Server
- `create-game` - Create a new game
- `join-game` - Join an existing game
- `cast-vote` - Cast a vote
- `reveal-votes` - Reveal all votes
- `reset-game` - Start a new round
- `change-deck` - Change the card deck

### Server to Client
- `game-created` - Game created successfully
- `player-joined` - Player joined the game
- `vote-cast` - Vote was cast
- `votes-revealed` - Votes have been revealed
- `game-reset` - Game has been reset
- `deck-changed` - Card deck has been changed
- `player-left` - Player left the game

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `PORT` - Server port (default: 3001)

### Docker Configuration
The application includes:
- Multi-stage Docker build for optimized production image
- Health checks for container monitoring
- Non-root user for security
- Proper signal handling for graceful shutdowns

## Deployment

### Docker Compose
The included `docker-compose.yml` provides:
- Port mapping (3001:3001)
- Health checks
- Restart policy

### Production Considerations
- Use a reverse proxy (nginx, Traefik) for SSL termination
- Set up proper logging and monitoring
