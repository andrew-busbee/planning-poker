# Planning Poker

A real-time planning poker application for agile estimation, deployable via Docker. No login required - each session creates a unique game URL that can be shared with team members.

## Features

- üéØ **Real-time voting** with WebSocket communication
- üÉè **Multiple card decks**: Fibonacci, T-shirt sizing, Powers of 2, Linear, or create your own
- üëÅÔ∏è **Watcher mode** for observers who can reveal votes and reset games
- üîó **Shareable game URLs** - no login required
- üì± **Responsive design** that works on desktop and mobile
- üåì **Light and dark modes** with theme toggle
- üê≥ **Docker deployment** ready
- ‚ö° **Instant updates** when players join, vote, or reveal results
- ‚è≥ **24-hour game persistence**: sessions stay active for 24 hours so teams can rejoin later without losing progress, with plans to consider extending persistence even longer

## Card Decks

### Fibonacci (Default)
0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ‚àû, ?, ‚òï

### T-Shirt Sizing
XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL, ?, ‚òï

### Powers of 2
0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ?, ‚òï

### Linear (1-10)
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, ?, ‚òï

### Custom Deck
Create your own custom deck to use during the game

Special cards:
- `‚àû` - Too complex to estimate
- `?` - Need more information
- `‚òï` - Take a break

## Quick Start with Docker

The Docker image is published as a multi-arch build and works on:
- x86_64 (Intel/AMD servers, PCs, cloud instances)
- ARM64 (Apple Silicon, Raspberry Pi 4/5, ARM servers)


The easiest way to deploy the application is with Docker Compose.  The [sample docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/andrew-busbee/planning-poker/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) file also has an optional healthcheck.

### Docker-compose (Recommended)
1. Create a folder to store the games.  Replace /path/to/data with your folder path.
```bash
mkdir -p /path/to/data
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /path/to/data
```
2. Create a docker-compose.yml with the following content (replace /path/to/data with what you set above).  The [sample docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/andrew-busbee/planning-poker/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) file also has an optional healthcheck.
```yml
services:
  planning-poker:
    image: andrewbusbee/planning-poker:latest
    ports:
      - "3001:3001"
    environment:
      - PORT=3001
      - LOG_LEVEL=INFO  # Options: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, SILENT
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - /path/to/data:/app/data
```

3. Start the container:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Docker
1. Create a folder to store the games.  Replace /path/to/data with your folder path.
```bash
mkdir -p /path/to/data
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /path/to/data
```
2. Run the container (replace /path/to/data with what you set above)
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name planning-poker \
  -p 3001:3001 \
  -e PORT=3001 \
  -e LOG_LEVEL=INFO \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -v /path/to/data:/app/data \
  andrewbusbee/planning-poker:latest
```
3. Open http://localhost:3001 in your browser.

### Environment Variables
- `PORT` - Server port (default: 3001)
- `LOG_LEVEL` - Application logging level (default: INFO).  
  See [Log Level Descriptions](#log-level-descriptions) for details.

## Log Level Descriptions

### DEBUG
- Most verbose logging level  
- Shows detailed debugging information including file paths, connection details, and internal state  
- Includes data directory setup, file operations, and connection cleanup details  
- Useful for development and troubleshooting issues  
- **Example:** `Data directory: /app/data, Connection details: socket123, Transport: websocket`

### INFO (default)
- Standard operational logging (recommended for production)  
- Shows important application events and status updates  
- Includes server startup, game creation/joining, player actions, and system metrics  
- Provides good visibility into application behavior without overwhelming detail  
- **Example:** `Game created and saved to disk: abc123, Player joined: John Doe`

### WARN
- Warning messages for potential issues  
- Highlights concerning situations that don't stop the application  
- Includes high latency connections, corrupted game data, and cleanup operations  
- Indicates issues that should be monitored but aren't critical  
- **Example:** `High latency detected: socket123, Latency: 2500ms, Failed to deserialize game data`

### ERROR
- Error conditions that need attention  
- Shows critical errors that affect functionality  
- Includes file system errors, connection failures, and data corruption  
- Indicates problems that may impact user experience or data integrity  
- **Example:** `Cannot write to data directory, Game not found: invalid-id`

### SILENT
- No logging output  
- Completely disables all logging  
- Useful for environments where logging is handled externally  
- Minimal resource usage but no visibility into application behavior


## Production Deployment Considerations
- Use a reverse proxy (nginx, Traefik) for SSL termination
- Consider setting up additional logging and monitoring
